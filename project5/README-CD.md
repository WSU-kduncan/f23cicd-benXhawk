# Part 1:

- Tags 

- The purpose of tags in a GitHub workflow is to mark important parts of the project, which can streamline the process to find 
which versions of the code are in a condition to be released. You can create tags via the 'create release' option on Github.com,
or with the git tag -a sampletagname command. Once the tag is created, it needs to be pushed to the current branch with git push
origin sampletagname
